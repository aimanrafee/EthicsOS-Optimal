# Human-Centric Design Principles

1. **Passive Notifications**: Notifications do not "intrude"; they wait for user attention.
2. **Natural Colors**: UI palette based on natural, earthy tones to reduce mental fatigue.
3. **Intentional Interaction**: Features that discourage mindless scrolling and encourage purposeful work.
4. **Data Transparency**: Every byte of data used is explained in simple, non-legal human language.
